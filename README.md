# BowCats

A demonstration iOS app that displays pictures of cats and allows real-time color manipulation using the Bow functional library for Swift and SwiftUI.

To find out more about Bow please visit https://bow-swift.io

This project uses several Monads, including IO and Either, as well as Optics and effects.

########

In order to see the cat pictures, you need to set up a key for the Cat API (yes, there is such a thing).  To do so, please visit https://thecatapi.com/ and sign up for a key.  Once you have a key, please enter it in your `local.properties` file as follows:

```
catApiKey="<your API key>"
```

Everything should *hopefully* just work from there.
